# Magic-People-Book-Examinant
This project will allow the user to manipulate a database of people, most likely helpful in keeping track of a large number of NPCs in a tabletop or video game. It currently holds the attributes of a person's unique name, profession, skill level, workplace, city, and a faction they may be a part of.
