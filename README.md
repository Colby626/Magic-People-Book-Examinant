The Mortal Tome allows users to manipulate a personalized database of up to a billion characters with my HTML, PHP, and SQL files. I purposefully arranged the simple design for individuals to benefit from this website with ease! Currently, the system allows for specific attributes such as unique names, professions, skill levels, workplaces, cities, and factions. However, the database is still under development as I hope to allocate more effort to other details, such as additional attributes and buttons. 

How To Use

1. Download XAMPP from this website: https://www.apachefriends.org/
